# Analysis of editorial activities on Wikipedia

## About the repo

The repo contains code for a project in my MSc course, which explains what I have done as part of the programme (and which is hopefully helpful for showing my ability of intermediate coding skills).

## Content

### Topic

The code analyses editorial activities (e.g., creating, editing, reverting articles) on Wikipedia to understand the dynamics of human interaction and behaviour on online platforms.
Here is a list of related research studies focusing on online editorial activities, networks, and communities on Wikipedia.

### Code structure

(TBU)

### Coding environment

I used Poetry to manage the Python environment. The `pyproject.toml` file contains the dependencies and the Python version used in the project.

## Note

- The code is written to solve particular problems which cannot be shared. Also, the repo **does not** contain data provided by the school, as sharing the data is not permitted.
- When solving the problem, we can only use simple modules such as `pickle`, `random`, `datetime`, and the packages `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`** to practice writing code. We can NOT use advanced data processing packages such as `pandas`, `networkx`, `scikitlearn`, etc.
